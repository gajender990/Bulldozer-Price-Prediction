Overview of Project:

1. Problem Statement
This machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers. 

2. Data
Dataset can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data

3. Evaluation:
For evaluation we are going to use RMSLE (root mean squared log error)

4. Features 
We can features of this dataset on https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ly-bLR8sbDJLITkWG7ozKm8l3RyieQ2Fpgix-beSYI/edit?usp=sharing

5. Modelling
For Modelling we are going to use RandomForestRegressor()

6. Experimentation
Trying to improve evaluation metrics through HyperParameter Tuning.
